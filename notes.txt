Notas para la rotacion de imagen:
Uses a 2x2 rotation matrix to perform the transformation
Calculates new image dimensions to fit the rotated image
Maps each pixel from the original image to its new rotated position
Handles the translation to keep the image centered
Note that this is a basic implementation and might be slower than PIL's built-in rotate function. Some improvements you could make:

Add interpolation for smoother results
Implement anti-aliasing
Add optimizations to reduce computation time
Handle different pixel formats
The mathematical concept behind this is the 2D rotation matrix:

[cos θ  -sin θ]
[sin θ   cos θ]

where θ is the rotation angle in radians.
